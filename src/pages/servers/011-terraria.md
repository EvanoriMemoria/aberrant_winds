## Mods and Addons
TShock has been installed for some commands, and protections. Otherwise the servers have Vanilla content, no mods.

## Server Side Characters
Characters are saved to the servers, all gear/progression must be made on Aberrant Winds servers or it will not transfer over. This is to prevent cheesing and bringing outside gear into the fresh servers, potentially ruining the experience for others.

## Progression
Servers will come online as certain benchmarks are met.
- ~~Enter Hardmode on Gentle Breeze~~ Complete! Chilling Wind and Crimson Wind are now open!
- ~~Kill Plantera on Chilling Wind to unlock~~ Complete!

## Inventory
Your inventory will sync between all Aberrant Winds servers. You can bring your gear from the Classic Server to the Expert/Master server and vice versa. 

## Events
Periodically, events will be enabled, such as Christmas and Halloween. 

## Streaming
I stream at 12 noon EST on Saturdays and around 8pm EST on Thursdays. Join us for some boss battles!

## Rules
I expect players to behave in a friendly manner, I will not tolerate toxicity, griefing, retaliation, etc. Punishments may range from mutes to bans. This is a cooperative game.
