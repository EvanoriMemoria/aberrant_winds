This pack is absolutely stuffed with nostalgia from your (or at least *my*) first modpacks circa 2014. There have been some updates and additions as well.

## Big hit mods:
- Botania
- Buildcrafts
- Thaumcraft 4
- AE2
- Mechanism Community Edition
- Tinker's Construct
- IC2
- Aroma Mining World (For all your quarrying needs)
- [Click here for full list of mods][4]

We do not have a protection system built into this modpack, I expect people not to grief or they will be banned, but just to be safe build your houses far from spawn.

## Rules
The rules are the same as every other Aberrant Winds server. Check the rules tab at the top to read them.
