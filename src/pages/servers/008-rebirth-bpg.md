This server was a test of the bpg edition of the Rebirth of the Night modpack, we may come back to it when there is another update.

About the modpack:

"A spin-off title of 'Rebirth of the Night', with a more emphasis on RPG elements such as classes, stats, and perks. While solo-play is plausible, it's recommended to play with a group of 2-4. No higher than a maximum of 4 players for the most optimal and best experience. You're encouraged to work together to survive the horrors that await you in the night. Each individual class(Levelup2 & Reskillable) has their own strengths and weaknesses to contribute to the team. Combatant classes will focus on fighting and defending allies, with their extra passive perks and new combat skills(Sword Skills & Stealth). Craftsman classes can focus on building tools, armor, potions, and base defenses(Ancient Warfare 2 & Dungeon Tactics & BetterWithMods). Gatherer classes should focus on farming for food, gathering materials, and overall exploring the world for loot (Treasure 2, Harvestcraft, Aquaculture, & FishingMadeBetter). It's up to you and your group to figure out how to work together, teamwork and efficiency is the key here. Death is punishing, but every death should resolve you to try harder. Remember, teamwork makes the dream work. Unless you're playing solo, then good luck on your adventures."
