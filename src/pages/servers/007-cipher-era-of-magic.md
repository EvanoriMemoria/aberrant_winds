"A pack full to the brim with mods that complete the magic fantasy experience!

Create incredible feats of magic with 6 unique magic systems, explore randomly generated dungeons and multiple dimensions, and loot until your backpack overflows with goodies! With Biome Bundle's diverse world generation and a quest progression system, you'll never run out of things to do, see, and explore!

With a focus on top-notch generation, exploration, magic, and a living world, Cipher: Era of Magic upgrades base Minecraft without overstepping any bounds. As such, this is no "all-the-mods" pack. We're trying to add just enough to make it feel like a brand new experience but not so much that it completely changes the game." - Mattlock in the pack description.
