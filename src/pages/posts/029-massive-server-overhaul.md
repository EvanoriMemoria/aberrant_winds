# Server Hardware Changes


Aberrant Winds is undergoing some large, and hopefully beneficial, changes.


First off, I'm restructuring the two machines I currently have running servers to use [ProxMox][1], a virtual environment that will hopefully allow for faster, smoother, more modular, and safer server setup. Additionally, I'm setting up a third machine which will host a RAID setup for server backups, which is fully supported through ProxMox and should keep our backups safe in the event of a hard drive failure on the main machines.


Unfortunately this will not be a quick transition, it may take a few weeks to get everything up and running again. I have limited time to work on projects and I will have to learn quite a lot to get all of this set up and the servers running again. Though, I suspect we'll be running again before the next ROTN update :P.


**Worlds will not be wiped!***


*Baring unfortunate/unforeseen issues.


# Server Monetization Changes


As you should all know, up to this point I've been doing all of this for free. I wish I could continue to do so, but it is just not feasible anymore in the world we live in and my living situation. I'll be honest, I feel a little dirty asking you guys for money, so hopefully I can make the servers worth it.


Here's what I'm thinking:


I have set up a [Ko-fi][2] (like Patreon, but more creator friendly). It has both a single donation option (You choose the amount) and a subscription option ($5.00/month). Every two or three months we will hold a vote for the next server to run and everyone that has donated that month, (single donation or subscription, at least $5.00) will get to add a game to the pool to be voted on. We will vote on the top three from the pool, then I will pick from those which one to host until the next vote comes around. Now for a few caveats.


First off, I have very limited server host room, so we cannot feasible run many of these servers at the same time. This means that at the end of every 2-3 month game session we will be shutting off the current server in favour of the next game. Now, at the end of the year we will have another vote to decide on one of the servers to boot back up and  keep running for the foreseeable future. I know that some people may lose interest since the servers will be shut down in a rather short amount of time, however, I plan to upload every map/world/save for the games that allow it to the Aberrant Winds cloud storage for download by anyone who wishes to do so. Hopefully this will offset the "everything will be gone so what's the point" mentality that we all fall prey to now and then. On top of that, I'm hoping the launch parties will be fun/entertaining/chaotic enough that people will want to continue coming back to participate for the foreseeable future.


One other potential issue that was brought to my attention is that not everyone will want to play every game and not everyone will be able to play every game. Unfortunately this is a reality of life, try as I may I am simply unable to accommodate everybody. Some people will be unable to purchase the games for launch, some will have little interest in the game, some might just be busy, somebody’s power might be out for the launch. There are a lot of things that can happen, but my intention is to keep this community fun, engaging, comfortable, and safe for as many people as I can.


With these issues in mind, I’ve been toying with the notion of starting to stream (probably on twitch, though I’ll be looking into alternatives as well). Ideally this will allow those without the capability/desire to play the games to watch and participate through the stream.


All of this is a test, I have no idea how it will turn out. Hopefully we can all have a good time and enjoy the experiences of playing some games together and potentially growing our little community outside of just minecraft and ROTN to something more.


With all of that out of the way, I will be hosting at least the first two of these events for free for everyone who would like to participate, so bring your friends!
