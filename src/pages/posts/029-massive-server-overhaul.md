## Preface: Community Input

I have always intended for the members of this community to have a say in what happens with the servers. This can be seen in the world reset votes we hold for wiping servers and in many more ways throughout this document. Now, I know this is a pretty big set of changes, and I want to have your input going forward. So, if you have an opinion, thoughts, ideas, constructive criticism, etc. I would love to hear it and have a discussion over on our discord. This will be restated quite a few times throughout this document. **Let me hear your thoughts! They *__will__* have an impact on the future of Aberrant Winds.**

## Server Hardware Changes

Aberrant Winds is undergoing some big changes.

First off, I'm restructuring the two machines I currently have running servers to use [ProxMox](https://www.proxmox.com/en/ "ProxMox"), a virtual environment which should allow for faster, smoother, more modular, and safer server setup. Additionally, I'm setting up a third machine which will host a RAID array for server backups, which is fully supported through ProxMox and should keep our backups extra safe.

**EDIT**
Machine restructure is complete. They are back up and running!

~~\## Timeframe~~
~~Unfortunately this will not be a quick transition, it may take a few weeks to get everything up and running again. Though, I suspect we'll be playing before the next ROTN update :P.~~ **EDIT** Only 6 days of downtime!

#### **Worlds were not wiped!**

## Server Monetization Changes

For the last two years I've been hosting these servers for free. I wish I could continue to do so, but it is just not feasible anymore for me to continue this way. I will be updating the ko-fi with goals for additional upgrades to the servers, or additional servers. I will continue to add these as we complete the current ones so everyone can see what sorts of upgrades we are currently working toward. I want this to be a community where everyone has some input, so to that end I have outlined my starting ideas. If anyone has additional input, let me know.

Here's what I'm thinking:

I have set up a Ko-fi (like Patreon, but more creator friendly). It has both a single donation option (You choose the amount) and a subscription option ($5.00/month). Every 1-3 months we will hold a community vote for the next server to set up and run. Everyone that has purchased a membership for the current game, (single purchase or subscription, at least $5.00) will get to vote on a game from the pool. Once a server has been voted on I will set it up, granted it’s possible given our limitations (linux compatible, resources, etc.). An additional $5 will then be charged for access to the new server for its duration.

### EDIT Server Duration

The servers will be available for 1-3 months. The community will vote toward the end of every month if they would like the current server to continue running, or switch to a new server. It is up to you guys. If it is a split outcome, I may run the servers side-by-side if possible, for its remaining duration, up to three months.

#### **** At least the first two game setup months will be free for everyone ****

This will allow us to work out some of the kinks and see what works without anyone worrying about the monetary side.

### EDIT What $5 gets you

The $5 charge will get you access to all Aberrant Winds servers while the current game is in Rotation. This means, if we set up a Terraria server and run it for three months you will get access to all terraria servers for the full three months, for just $5. This is different from my original idea, but fits my style better.

## Game Vote Setup

One of the limitations of this system is our limited server resources, so we cannot feasibly run many of these servers at the same time. While this should improve with time, for now this means that at the end of every 1-3 month game session we will be shutting off the current server in favour of the next game. Now, at the end of the year we will have another vote to decide on one of the servers to boot back up and keep running for the foreseeable future. I know that some people may lose interest since the servers will be shut down in a finite amount of time, however, I plan to upload every map/world/save (for the games that allow it) to the Aberrant Winds cloud storage for download by anyone who wishes to do so. Hopefully this will offset the "everything will be gone so what's the point" mentality that we all fall prey to now and then. On top of that, I'm hoping the launch parties will be fun/entertaining/chaotic enough that people will want to continue coming back to participate for the foreseeable future. If you’ve played Path of Exile, I’m going for a league launch vibe; exciting, anticipation building, communal, and fun!

My intention is to keep this community fun, engaging, comfortable, and safe for as many people as I can. Below are some of the steps I would like to take toward this goal. If you have additional thoughts on how to improve these systems let's talk about it in our discord!

### Streaming

Starting up a stream and potentially partnering with other streamers for the launches. Ideally this will allow those who are unable to play themselves to still participate vicariously, while simultaneously being a vector for new members.

### Giveaways

I would love to eventually give out as many copies of the game we will be playing that month as possible to those watching the stream, or in the discord, with donations not required to win. Those who win will also get free entry into the launch. I hope to contact developers to potentially source copies of their game, but we'll probably need to be more established for this to work reliably. I will also be adding free membership time into the giveaways, so keep an eye out for that!

### In-game Challenges / Races

This one greatly depends on the game, but people have had fun getting the dragon armour in ROTN as fast as they can. I can imagine it being fun to have goals people meet, both race-like (first to X) or more static (Beat a boss/have a set of gear/kill xxx monsters solo or as a group) over the course of the game instance’s life. We should discuss prizes for completion as well as challenges in the discord as well, let’s hear your ideas. Participation will be completely optional of course.

## Private Servers

I will be hosting some private servers for any applicable game, in addition to the above changes. These will not come at the expense of the public servers, but will run alongside them. I currently have them priced at $30/month. I will set them up, host them, and those paying for them will get to play on the server with the permissions of their choosing (admin, operator, nothing) and a whitelist for only those they wish to play with. I can potentially support mods, but this heavily depends on the game being hosted. I hope this will generate some additional income to continue growing the community, and perhaps start some advertising. Our limited server resources mean I can only host a couple of these, for the moment that limit is 2, so if you'd like to have a private server hosted by me, head over to the [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/aberrantwinds "Aberrant Winds' Ko-fi").

## Final Thoughts

All of this is a big test, I have no idea how it will turn out. Hopefully we can all have a good time and enjoy the experiences of playing some games together and potentially growing our little community outside of just minecraft and ROTN to something more. I look forward to this adventure with you guys!

## FAQ

* **How much will it cost to participate?**
  $5 to have access for the entire duration of the current game.
* **What kinds of games will work for this?**
  Valheim, Project Zomboid, Rust, Ark: Survival Evolved, Minecraft (and modpacks), Satisfactory, Path of Titans, Terraria, 7 Days to Die, Lego Universe, etc. [Here’s a list](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Dedicated_Servers_List "Valve Dedicated Server List") of just the ones on steam, make sure you look at the linux section.
* **What about the currently active servers?**
  We will be keeping some of the current servers up, whichever ones continue to have interest. ~~I may make two versions, one free and one private for donors, I haven’t decided yet, again I'll need some input from you guys on this.~~ **EDIT there will not be private versions of the minecraft servers** ROTN will be staying as it was the foundation of our community, as much of a mess as it is. It is likely EOI will be making a comeback, otherwise I’m not sure about the rest. If you want to see a specific one stay, message me on discord.
* **What about the people who have been here forever? Do we still have to pay?**
  No, only pay if you have the means/want to support the server. There will be a time limit on this, such that anyone who participates in the coming months will have a free pass, at least for a while. While those who arrive later / return later, will not get the same benefits.

  **How about games that don't support enough players?**
  I will attempt to set up as many instances as are needed to play the game with everyone who is participating. This does mean there will be some separation of players, but we'll figure out specifics when we get there.
