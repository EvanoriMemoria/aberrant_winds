The Edge of Infinity modpack has released a new update! This update includes a larger maximum size for Davinci's Vessels, Waystones, along with various fixes and tweaks. Additionally Millenaire has been added to the modpack, making villages much more interactive and allow players to help them grow! This modpack will no longer be able to be updated through the Technic Launcher due to technical difficulties.

Please note: You do not have to manually download these mods, updating the modpack from curseforge is all that is required.
