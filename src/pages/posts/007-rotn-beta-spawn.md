Spawn hub for the RoTN beta server is complete! A big thanks to Kale and Alee for their awesome work!

"Our current theme in mind for RoTN 3.0 Beta 5 focuses around the new Onslaught invasions where players will need to bunker down against the hoard of mobs sent against them every 9 in-game days. 

This hub will feature an old bunker nearly falling apart without resources where players make their journey to unknown lands and beyond in order to fight for survival in the hostile world of Rebirth of the Night." - Kale
