## First Load In
The game will ask you to pick an origin **This is fake**. It has already randomly selected your origin for you. Select any of them and **press esc** when the dirt screen shows up to continue into the game. A little buggy, but it's what we have for the moment.

---

## Origins
Origins are randomly chosen on death, their gameplay impact varies wildly. If you do not like your current origin you can use the /randomise command to be transformed! More uses of /randomise can be gained by placing a single Block of Diamond in your offhand. (Official Reincarnation Server Only)

Some Origins have been disabled due to negative gameplay impacts or bugs. If you come across another that feels bad to play, let me know and I'll look into it further.

## Client Side Mods & Performance
On low end PCs you may wish to remove the following mods as they can impact performance.These mods can be removed without affecting your ability to connect to servers.
- [Dynamic Surroundings](https://modrinth.com/mod/dynamicsurroundings_remasteredfabric)
- [Sound Physics Remastered](https://modrinth.com/mod/sound-physics-remastered)

## Lives
~~You start with just 6 lives, and every time you die, your origin will be randomized. Putting a single Enchanted Golden Apple in your offhand will gain you one additional life! (Official Reincarnation Server Only)~~
Disabled for the moment as they were buggy, and the pack is hard.

## Mobs
- As a general rule mobs get stronger the further from spawn you go. This includes up and down from Sea Level, so be careful out there!
- Be cautious when out on the ocean, Sea Monsters appear during storms!
- Rarely, a creeper will spawn charged, they are significantly more destructive.
- Mutants are quite a challenge, running may be required.

---

## Gear
- Every new player spawns with a basic set of gear, including a single use Orb of Origin which can be used to select your origin!
- Orb of Origin can also be found rarely as loot in dungeons.
- Shields are good. (For most origins)
- Weapons from Simply Swords are some of the best in the pack!
- Golden loot chests have instanced loot for every player. So everyone can loot the same dungeon!

## Keybinds
There are some hidden keybinds, if you do not like the inventory changes you can turn them off in the r+c menu, there are a lot of options in this menu, but it is a very customizable mod, play around with it!

---

## Customizable Player Models
A super cool new mod that allows you to create your own player model with unique animations. Check out the mod page here: [Customizable Player Models](https://modrinth.com/plugin/custom-player-models) or join their [discord](https://discord.com/invite/mKyXdEsMZD)
