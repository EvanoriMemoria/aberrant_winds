## Origins
Origins are randomly chosen on death, their gameplay impact varies wildly. If you do not like your current origin you can use the /randomise command to be transformed! More uses of /randomise can be gained by placing a single Block of Diamond in your offhand. (Official Reincarnation Server Only)

Some Origins have been disabled due to negative gameplay impacts. If you come across another that feels bad to play, let me know and I'll look into it further.

## Client Side Mods & Performance
On low end PCs you may wish to remove the following mods as they can impact performance.These mods can be removed without affecting your ability to connect to servers.
- [Dynamic Surroundings](https://modrinth.com/mod/dynamicsurroundings_remasteredfabric)
- [Sound Physics Remastered](https://modrinth.com/mod/sound-physics-remastered)

## Lives
You start with just 6 lives, and every time you die, your origin will be randomized. Putting a single Enchanted Golden Apple in your offhand will gain you one additional life! (Official Reincarnation Server Only)

---

## Mobs
- As a general rule mobs get stronger the further from spawn you go. This includes up and down from Sea Level, so be careful out there!
- Be cautious when out on the ocean, Sea Monsters appear during storms!
- Rarely, a creeper will spawn charged, they are significantly more destructive.
- Mutants are quite a challenge, running may be required.

---

## Gear
- Every new player spawns with a basic set of gear, including an Origin Stone to pick your Origin just once!
- Shields are good. (For most origins)
- Weapons from Simply Swords are some of the best in the pack!
