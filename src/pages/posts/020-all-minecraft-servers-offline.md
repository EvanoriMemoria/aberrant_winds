All Aberrant Winds minecraft servers are temporarily disabled due to the log4j vulnerability. I believe this is the safest option at the moment and will work this weekend to implement any good fixes when they become available.

If anyone else is running a server, patch information can be found here: [Minecraft Server Patch Information][1]
