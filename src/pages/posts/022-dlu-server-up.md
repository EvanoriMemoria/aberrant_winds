The official Aberrant Winds' Darkflame LEGO® Universe server is now available to this community! In order to register for an account you must message fergenbergel for a key and the url.

You must also download the client version 1.10.64, which cannot be distributed here. This means you have to find it online yourself through google.

Your client *must* be version 1.10.64. Saymoan's guide has a [Client Setup][2] section which is mandatory to complete to progress on the server.

This is an incredibly buggy game at the moment, so if you do begin playing on the server be sure you are ready for weird bugs, loss of items and progress, and non-functional items and skills. 

To connected to the server you must change this line in your boot.cfg to match: "AUTHSERVERIP=0:aberrantwinds.xyz," and have set up an account by messaging fergenbergel on discord.
