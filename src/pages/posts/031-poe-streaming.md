## Path of Exile
PoE is a free isometric Action RPG, it has one of the most in-depth build creation tools of any game I have played. With that comes a lot of complexity and replayability, the game has a steep learning curve. I am here to assist and answer questions on discord or on stream. 

## [Streaming][2]

I am going to level at least one character and play a bit of endgame, we'll see what happens. I'm open to people joining me, new or otherwise. The game is rather complex so playing solo for a bit and asking questions is one of the better ways to learn, in my experience. I don't have a set time for these streams, it will likely be whenever I decide to play.
