I have set up a [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com) instance running on a Raspberry Pi. If you would like to set up your own instance on a Raspberry Pi, I found [this post](https://www.makeuseof.com/raspberry-pi-nextcloud/amp/) to be helpful. Otherwise it generally runs better on other linux servers. You may need some networking experience to get out of local network access, but it was a very fun project! I am hosting this as a private service for friends and family so if you fall into those categories and already have an account, head on over to [https://cloud.aberrantwinds.xyz](https://cloud.aberrantwinds.xyz) to sign in and have a look!
