Just the other day we had a nice little dust storm in the evening, the window happened to be open and everything was covered in a nice fine layer of dust. So here we are, just a few days later with some freshly un-dusted servers! Each server was down for less than 20 minutes and everything is running smoothly and with extra ventilation today.
